A. Find Vulnerability
1. Find the vulnerability on our API testing.addityar.xyz
2. Can provide security solutions from vulnerabilities found

========================== The Answer ======================
I found some vulnerabilities in the API, I used the nessus to scanning. here are the results i found :
- Result Scan.html
- Result Scan.csv

============================================================

B. Test Cases
As Security Engineer you must secure your infrastructure and API services, if your API
always get attack from attacker ( ddos , brute force, etc ). How should you handle the
attack?. Can you give advice on how to design the best security for infrastructure
security and API services.

========================== The Answer ======================

As a Security Engineer, I will always do periodic Scanning to find out whether the System/API I am using is vulnerable so that there is an early prevention effort. For attack I will do a system vulnerability scanning if it is found. For solutions on how to design security, I can do various activities such as
1. Network Security Checklist
2. Network and System Hardening
3. Using Cryptography
4. Scheduling Network and System Vulnerability Scans
5. zero-trust


============================================================

C. Security checklist
You are asked to assess a new mobile application (android and ios) , this mobile application has
backend API as well resided in cloud. What are the checklist / to-dos to ensure security
measurement is enough for the app go live.

========================== The Answer ======================

To make sure the app goes to live, I do various checks such as :
1. Eliminate vulnerabilities before applications go into production.
To Address application security before development is complete, it is essential to build security into the development team

2. Address security in open source or third-party architecture, design, and components.
If we check for bugs in our code or run a penetration test on our system. We may lose a large number of vulnerabilities in our system

3. Adopt security tools integrated into the developer environment.
One way to do this is with an IDE plugin, which allows developers to see security results directly in the IDE as they work on their code

4. Build an "AppSec toolbelt" that brings together the solutions needed to address risks.
An effective Appsec toolbelt should include integrated solutions that address application security risks, and provide vulnerability analysis in proprietary code, open-source components, runtime configuration and behaviour.

5. Analysis of application security risks.
Knowing application security is very important to be able to focus efforts on preventing or correcting risks
